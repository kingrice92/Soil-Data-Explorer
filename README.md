# Soil-Data-Explorer

This is a collection of work that was completed as part of my final project for CSCI 6221 at GW in Fall 2020.
This repository contains sample scripts to query the soil data mart for various data outputs.

## Requirements

1. python json package
2. python urllib3 package

Note the import messages at the top of each script

These packages come preinstalled with Anaconda, which is the python kit I used for all of my work.
It can be downloaded here: https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual

## Run Instructions

Once Anaconda is installed, launch the Spyder development environment from the Anaconda navigator and these scripts should work out of the box.
